        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>A classic winter warmer - you can't go wrong with pumpkin soup. Hearty, delicious and perfectly paired with your favourite toast. Enjoy our rendition of this classic.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
            <li>2 onions, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 kg of pumpkin</1i>
            <li>150 double cream</li>
            <li>700ml chicken stock</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large saucepan, then gently cook 2 finely chopped onions for 5 mins, until soft but not coloured.</li>
            <li>Add 1kg pumpkin or squash, cut into chunks, to the pan, then carry on cooking for 8-10 mins, stirring occasionally until it starts to soften and turn golden.</li>
            <li>Pour 700ml vegetable or chicken stock into the pan and season with salt and pepper. Bring to the boil, then simmer for 10 mins until the squash is very soft.</li>
            <li>Pour 150ml double cream into the pan, bring back to the boil, then pur√©e with a hand blender. For an extra-velvety consistency you can pour the soup through a fine sieve. <em>The soup can now be frozen for up to 2 months</em></li>
